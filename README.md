Diabetes Risk Predication Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health parameters. The project is implemented using Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis, model training, and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset includes medical attributes such as Glucose Level, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure.
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
Technologies Used
Python 🐍
pandas & numpy for data processing
scikit-learn for machine learning
seaborn & matplotlib for visualization
Model Training
Supervised Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest were applied.
Data split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results & Insights
Achieved X% accuracy on test data.
Identified key factors contributing to diabetes risk.
Visualized the correlation between different health indicators.
